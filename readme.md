Touch sampling at every 100ms to find the position of the touch and updating the LED color based on the output. LEDs also follow a sequence as given in requirement.


Review Points:

1)Separate files for touch and led initialization
2)Changing values in Array to 5, 10, 20 & 30
3)Comments in main & .c files for respective functions
4)Need to remove Warnings due to Implicite declaration of functions
